A simple implementation of the Hangman game. 

Very bad design, bad user experience and not all functions are 100% finished.  
But a very nice exercise in using different layouts for separate orientations, using dialogboxes and bundles.  

All the basic functionalities to play hangman are implemented. A random word gets picked from a dictionary for the user to guess.
